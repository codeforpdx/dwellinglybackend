## Description

The nonprofit Join is currently working to help transition people out of homelessness. However, their current system for staying in touch with landlords is currently inadequate.  This app aims to replace their current system with a robust ticketing system to ensure the staff at Join can connect with their landlords and clients seamlessly. This will allow Join to provide support and improve success in transitioning people out of homelessness.
